##Milestone Project 1

This project is my website to showcase my skills as a Junior Full Stack Developer, with an online portfolio to demonstrate knowledge and experience. This is initially focussing on Front End development.

I have decided to start this portfolio for myself, which can be updated and improved as my knowledge and experience grows.

###Colours

I chose to keep it simple by using black, white and grey.

I chose to use ….. for my logo as I wanted my name to have a stylish cursive font. I chose …. throughout the website as it appears fun and friendly. I used sizing, word spacing and letter spacing to change the format throughout.
