# Aleesha Kara - Web Developer profile

## User Centric Frontend Development Milestone Project 


![Image](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/aleeshakara.github.io/blob/master/assets/images/favicon.png "favicon") 


This project is my website, showcasing my (future) skills as a Web Developer, with an online portfolio to demonstrate knowledge and experience. This is initially focused on Front End development.

I decided to start this portfolio for myself, which can be updated and improved as my knowledge and experience grows.

### Wireframes

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) was used to create the wireframes for mobile and desktop. This gave me an opportunity to make decisions about the layout across the screen sizes. The final website differs from the original plan, because the site doesn't appear as overcrowed as initially thought. 
Please see below:
* [Desktop](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/milestone-1/blob/master/wireframes/Wireframes-MS1.pdf)
* [Mobile](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/milestone-1/blob/master/wireframes/%20mobile-MS1.pdf)


## Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page:
* Consists of:
  - A photo of me for people to connect with me as a person
  - About Me- A brief background about myself
  - What I Can Do- Brief details about my skills. This is what I hope to achieve moving forward. It will be updated, when appropriate
  - How I Can Help- Creating a tailored a experience for users
This page allows the users to get to know me.

#### Contact Page:
* Contains a contact form. It gives the user the option of submitting their details for me to get in touch within a couple of days. This is a Bootstrap template. I plan to redesign the form and make it fully interactive in the future

#### Projects:
* This page is to show a variety of different types and styles of work I have done. Currently for appearance. The code was copied StartBootstrap. Hope to show images as links to live sites in the future. As I currently have limited experience, there are restrictions in what the site has to offer.

#### Skills:
* Shows users my skills (some in theory), to date

#### All Pages:
* The navigation menu is at the top of each page. It allows users to access all of the website’s pages and the CV in a separate page, allowing the user to return to the website easily
* The footer contains links for the contact, CV and social media links
All links have a silver hover

#### Colours

I chose to keep it simple by using black, white and grey. I feel it offers a clean look and allowed me to use other elements to catch the users' attention. The Projects page contains colour, as I have copied the original code for the page.

#### Fonts

I chose to use "Sacramento" for my logo as I wanted my name to have a stylish cursive font. I chose "Balsamiq Sans" throughout the website as it appears fun and friendly. I used sizing, word spacing and letter spacing to change the format throughout.


### Features Left to Implement

* A live website, preferably with my own domain
* Projects to be added as and when created
* Up to date CV
* Features required to complete the contact form.
* Links to my professional social media, which I need to set up.
