## Milestone Project 1

![Image](https://github.com/Aleeshakara/milestone-1/blob/master/assets/images/favicon.png "favicon") 

This project is my website to showcase my skills as a Junior Full Stack Developer, with an online portfolio to demonstrate knowledge and experience. This is initially focused on Front End development.

I have decided to start this portfolio for myself, which can be updated and improved as my knowledge and experience grows.

## Features

### Existing Features

#### Home Page:
* Consists of 3 sections-
  - About Me- A brief background about myself
  -
  - What- Brief details about what I can offer. This is what I hope to achieve moving forward. It will be updated, when appropriate
  - A photo of myself
  
#### Contact Page:
* Contains a contact form. This is a Bootstrap template. I plan to redesign the form and make it fully interactive in the future

#### Projects:
* Currently for appearance. Hope to show images as links to live sites. Contains completed projects (courtesy of Code Institute tutorial videos). Images contain links to external responsive sites. As I have currently only used HTML and CSS, there are restrictions in what the site has to offer.

#### Skills:
* Shows my skills (in theory), to date

#### All Pages:
* The navigation menu is at the top of each page. It allows users to access all of the website’s pages and the CV in a separate page, allowing the user to return to the website easily
* The footer contains links for the contact, CV and social media links
All links have a silver hover

#### Colours

I chose to keep it simple by using black, white and grey. I feel it offers a clean look and allowed me to use other elements to catch the users' attention.

#### Fonts

I chose to use "Sacramento" for my logo as I wanted my name to have a stylish cursive font. I chose …. throughout the website as it appears fun and friendly. I used sizing, word spacing and letter spacing to change the format throughout.


### Features Left to Implement

* A live website, preferably with my own domain
* Projects to be added as and when created
* Up to date CV
* Features required to complete the contact form.
* Links to my professional social media, which I need to set up.
* Blog, videos or newsletter with my personal journey, along with help and advice.
* Accessibility adjustments (Content Adjustments, Colour & Display Adjustments, Navigation Adjustments)
* Interactive (using Javascript)

## Self Reflection

Before this project, I had very little knowledge of coding. I enjoyed some of the journey. I started out with the idea of using black, white and purple, as being my favourite colours, I believe d they would truly represent my brand. Once I started putting the colours together, removing the purple seemed the best idea, including changing my image to ‘grayscale’. 

I knew I’d have issues, so a lot of my ideas never made it to the  finished project. I hope to incorporate some of those ideas into future projects.

I worked hard, put many stressful hours into this. I hope to update my portfolio , in order to use after this course.
