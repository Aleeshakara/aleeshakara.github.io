This project is my website to showcase my skills as a Junior Full Stack Developer, with an online portfolio to demonstrate knowledge and experience. This is initially focused on Front End development.

I have decided to start this portfolio for myself, which can be updated and improved as my knowledge and experience grows.

## Features

### Existing Features

* Home Page-
* Contact Page-

* Skills-
* All Pages-

The contact form allows users to contact me, by completing their details.
The navigation menu allows users to access all of the website’s pages and the CV in a separate page.
The footer contains links for the contact, CV and social media links.

### Colours

I chose to keep it simple by using black, white and grey. I feel it offers a clean look and allowed me to use other elements to catch the users' attention.

### Fonts

I chose to use "Sacramento" for my logo as I wanted my name to have a stylish cursive font. I chose …. throughout the website as it appears fun and friendly. I used sizing, word spacing and letter spacing to change the format throughout.

##Reflection

Before this project, I had very little knowledge of coding.
I enjoyed some of the journey. I started out with the idea of using black, white and purple, as being my favourite colours, I believe d they would truly represent my brand. Once I started putting the colours together, removing the purple seemed the best idea, including changing my image to ‘grayscale’. 

I knew I’d have issues, so a lot of my ideas never made it to the  finished project. I hope to incorporate some of those ideas into future projects.

I worked hard, put many stressful hours into this. I hope to update my portfolio , inorder to use after this course.

Thank you for your time,
Aleesha
